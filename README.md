# Work in Progress

## Introduction

### Purpose

"Burned Ones" is a social media designed specifically for minorities. It's a space where users can:

- Share valuable resources. Know a friendly doctor or an understanding therapist? Share them here.
- Tell their stories. Every story is anonymous, with pseudonyms automatically assigned, allowing people to freely express without fear.

### Inspiration

Drawing from my personal experiences as a mixed-race Latina/white woman and the tales of my peers, this platform was born. We believe in the strength of shared narratives and the comfort of collective wisdom.

### Target Audience

Our community is for minorities, women, and LGBTQIA+ individuals üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è‚ößÔ∏è. It's for anyone who's felt marginalized and is seeking both a voice and an ear.
